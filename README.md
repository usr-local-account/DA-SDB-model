## Introduction

DA-SDB (domain adaptation-based deep learning model for satellite-derived bathymetry) is a deep learning model designed to address the generalization challenges in satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) across spatial and temporal domains. Traditional empirical models exhibit limited transferability due to domain shifts caused by variations in water quality, substrate types, and atmospheric conditions. Our proposed DA-SDB model leverages domain adaptation techniques to significantly enhance generalization capability, providing an efficient and cost-effective solution for bathymetric mapping in remote areas and long-term monitoring of critical regions.

This research conducted extensive spatial and temporal transfer experiments across five diverse study areas (Dongsha Atoll, Bimini Island, South Warden Reef, Hadrah Island, and Mubarraz and Bu Tinah Islands), demonstrating the significant performance advantages of the DA-SDB model compared to existing methods, with stable performance in cross-regional and cross-temporal application scenarios.

## Key Features

- **Robust Generalization**: Employs domain adaptation to effectively apply models trained on source domains to target domains without requiring labeled target data
- **End-to-End Architecture**: Integrates three componentsâ€”feature extractor, bathymetry predictor, and domain aligner
- **Innovative Feature Extraction Modules**:
  - **Pyramid-Like Block (PLB)**: Multi-channel neural network structure that effectively extracts multi-dimensional features
  - **Physical-Assisted Block (PAB)**: Utilizes spectral slope information to enhance the model's ability to extract wavelength-related features
- **Robust Domain Alignment**: Aligns the pseudo-inverse Gram matrices to mitigate distribution differences between source and target domains
- **Direct Use of TOA Reflectance**: Operates without complex atmospheric correction, simplifying the data processing pipeline

## Datasets

This research utilizes the following data sources:

- **Sentinel-2 L1C Data**: Provides multispectral remote sensing imagery
- **ICESat-2 ATL03 Data**: Provides high-precision bathymetric reference data
- **Study Areas Covering Five Locations**:
  - Dongsha Atoll (South China Sea)
  - Bimini Island (Great Bahama Bank)
  - South Warden Reef (Great Barrier Reef)
  - Hadrah Island (Southern Red Sea)
  - Mubarraz and Bu Tinah Islands (Persian Gulf)

## The easiest way to reproduce the results is to load the saved model:
```python
# Test the model
